modules:

  - name: Example Introduction
    id: introduction
    resources:
      - header: This is an example module with _no challenges_!
      - name: Welcome
        markdown: |
          You can put markdown _here_ as well!
          The `resources` section allows you to add different resources depending on the keys you provide
          for each item. You can add:

          - videos, by providing `name`, `video`, and `playlist` entries. The `video` entry is the youtube video ID, the `playlist` entry is the youtube playlist ID, and the `slides` entry is the Google Slides document ID.
          - slides (must provide `slides` key)
          - expandable markdown text (by providing `markdown`, like this)
          - embedded markdown text (by providing `header`).
          - iframed data (by providing `iframe`)
      - name: "An example video with slides"

  - name: Example Module With Challenges
    id: original-challenges
    resources:
      - name: click me!
        markdown: of course, you can have resources and challenges in the same module
    challenges:
      - description: |
          You can give a good description in _markdown_!
        name: level1
        category: example-challenges
      - name: level2
        category: example-challenges

  - name: Example Module With Imported Challenges
    id: imported-challenges
    resources:
      - header: You can import challenges from other modules, as demonstrated here! You can optionally provide your own description.
    challenges:
      - import: cse365/misuse/level1
      - import: cse365/misuse/level2
        description: this is a custom description!

  - name: Example Module With Due Dates
    id: with-due-dates
    time_visible: 2023-01-01T13:00:00-07:00
    time_assigned: 2023-01-01T13:00:00-07:00
    time_ec_part: 2023-02-19T18:30:00-07:00
    time_ec_full: 2023-02-21T00:00:00-07:00
    time_due: 2023-02-25T11:00:00-07:00
    late_penalty: 0.5
    ec_threshold: 2
    resources:
      - header: |
          You can set a number of attributes on the module level:

          - `time_visible` controls when the module and its resources (but not challenges) will become visible
          - `time_assigned` controls when the module challenges become accessible
          - `time_due` controls when the `late_penalty` (which is 0.5 by default) is applied to challenge solves. Challenges remain accessible after this time.
          - `time_ec_part` and `time_ec_full` control "early bird" extra credit. If students solve `ec_threshold` challenges before `time_ec_full`, they get 1% extra credit to their final grades. Otherwise, if they solve `ec_threshold/2` challenges before `time_ec_part`, they get 0.5% extra credit.
    challenges:
      - import: cse365/misuse/level1
      - import: cse365/misuse/level2
      - import: cse365/misuse/level3
      - import: cse365/misuse/level4
